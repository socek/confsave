Conifg Saver should be able to save local linux configs. It should be able to list configs and ignore part of them.

cs u/untracked -> list untracked files
cs a/add -> add files to track

What do we need:
- directory for storing repo of config files
- list of tracked files
- ignore list
- config file in yaml
